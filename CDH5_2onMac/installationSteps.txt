This document list down the steps  needed for installing CDH5.3 on Mac
One can always get the source code, build and setup the environment
but doing so for many projects is takes a lot of work. More-over when working on
OpenSource projects one works on 2-3 projects at a time, so having the basic stuff working
as its suppose to be, becomes important.

Iternaries taken care as a part of this document

* Hbase
* Hive
* Spark

FAQ:
1. Error "Exception from container-launch" 
>> This happens because of a syntactical issue, in which the hadoop-config.sh gets rendered on Mac.
   Execute the following:
    - find . -name hadoop-config.sh
    - Change the following,
    Original ->
        "
        if [ "Darwin" == "$(uname -s)" ]; then
       if [ -x /usr/libexec/java_home ]; then
           export JAVA_HOME=($(/usr/libexec/java_home))
       else
           export JAVA_HOME=(/Library/Java/Home)
       fi
   fi"
   
   Changed ->
   "if [ "Darwin" == "$(uname -s)" ]; then
       if [ -x /usr/libexec/java_home ]; then
           export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)
       else
           export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/Home
       fi
   fi
    Change is needed in setting the JAVA_HOME path, remove the bracket around the paths defined.
